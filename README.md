Allocate more inventory and marketing budget to Naypyitaw, as it consistently generates the highest revenue. Explore opening more stores or launching exclusive promotions in this high-performing region.

Since Mandalay has the lowest revenue, investigate local consumer preferences and adjust product offerings or pricing strategies. Consider targeted promotions to increase footfall and conversion rates.

As Food and Beverages is the top-performing category, consider expanding its variety or bundling offers to further increase sales. Feature it prominently in-store and online to capitalize on existing demand.

4.Improve Visibility of Health and Beauty Products

Health and Beauty, being the least performing line, may benefit from rebranding, promotions, or repositioning. Investigate customer preferences and consider strategic discounts or influencer marketing to boost sales.

5.Strengthen Loyalty Programs for Member Customers

Since Member customers contribute the highest revenue and taxes, invest in loyalty programs, personalized offers, and early-access sales to retain and reward these valuable customers.

6.Enhance Ewallet Payment Experience

As Ewallet is the most used payment method, ensure that the process is smooth, fast, and secure. Offer additional cashback or discounts for Ewallet users to encourage continued use.
